# School project: Ocha - A traditional Japanese tea farm

This repository is the backbone for the second project in the first semester of Interaction Design at Fagskolen Kristiania. 
The goal for this project was make our first, ideal website using HTML and CSS. Both versions for desktop and mobile,
was first made visually using Figma, before writing the code in VS Code.


Ocha, the Japanese tea farm, is fictional and does not exist. It was actually not my intention to make a website for a tea farm at all. 
A mish-mash of elements during a week, subconsiously inspired me to do so anyway: The combination of the colors from a fig and 
lemon, my love for a cup of high quality tea - and our teacher using a Japanese font in a lecture. While doing research, I also could not 
help but notice how glaring most existing websites for tea farms look (really not comparable to the quality of the products they are mindfully cultivating, growing and handpicking). This motivated me even more - so here it is: The desktop and mobile version for Ocha.
